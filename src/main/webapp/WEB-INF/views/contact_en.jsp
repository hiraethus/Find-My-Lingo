    Find my Lingo is a website which attempts to let speakers of all languages the World over to find services in
    their area that cater to their preferred language. If you own a cafe, restaurant or working in local government or a
    private business, we welcome you to register and fill in the form above to let us know that you can provide your
    services in a language that you care about.

    Thank you for visiting Find my Lingo. The website is currently in its early stages of development. It is hoped that,
    with enough interest the website will expand to help people from all language communities. If you would
    like to contact us directly, please email <a href="mailto:meicaljohnjones@gmail.com">meicaljohnjones@gmail.com</a>.
    All suggestions, corrections and complaints are greatly appreciated.

    We hope you can help in celebrating services both small and large, private and public, who
    champion language diversity and building strong bonds in their community.
