# Gwasanaethau Cymru

[http://gwasanaethau.cymru/](http://gwasanaethau.cymru/)

Gwasanaethau Cymru is a side project to enable speakers of [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language) 
to use Welsh-language services in their local area. I intend for this project to 
allow businesses and local authorities to create profiles for their own services 
and to allow people to rate the standard of the service provided to them 
through the medium of Welsh.

The intention of this project is to make this codebase generic and well 
documented such that other technically minded people might host their own 
portals for their respective minority languages.
